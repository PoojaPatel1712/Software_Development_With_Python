## Assignment Project - Didital Clock

This Python program creates a digital clock GUI using the Tkinter library. The clock displays the current time (hour, minute, and second) along with the AM/PM indicator. It also shows the current date (day, month, year) and the day of the week. The clock updates every 200 milliseconds to keep the time and date information accurate and real-time.

The clock GUI has a yellow background and consists of the following elements:

- Hour, Minute, Second, and AM/PM labels to display the time.
- Date, Month, Year, and Day labels to display the date information.

The clock continuously updates to show the current time and date in real-time, making it a useful and interactive digital clock application.

## Calculator

This Python program creates a simple calculator GUI using the Tkinter library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input expressions and get the result by clicking on the appropriate buttons. The interface has been styled with a pleasant color scheme and a clear display.

## Language Translator

The Language Translator Application is a Python-based GUI tool with Tkinter. It enables users to input text, select source and target languages, and receive real-time translations using Google Translate API. The app supports various languages, offers text-to-speech output, and features an intuitive interface, promoting cross-cultural communication and language learning.

## To Do List

This Python program creates a simple To-Do List GUI using the Tkinter library. The GUI allows users to add tasks to the list using the "Add Task" button, which takes the task from the entry widget and appends it to the list. Users can delete a selected task from the list using the "Delete Task" button. The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
